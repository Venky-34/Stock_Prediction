# Stock_Prediction

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is particularly well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, such as stock price prediction. LSTMs are capable of capturing long-range dependencies in sequences, making them suitable for analyzing time-series data like stock prices. In this example, we'll use historical stock price data to train an LSTM model and then use it to predict future stock prices.
